# Basketball Player Analysis and Shot Prediction Application

This project involves a desktop application and a website to showcase and distribute the work done on basketball player analysis, pose estimation, and shot prediction. The application uses advanced image processing and computer vision techniques to assist players in improving their game.

## Features

### Desktop Application
1. **Pose Estimation**: 
   - Tracks player movements in real-time.
   - Identifies key body positions to analyze basketball-related actions.

2. **Basketball Shot Prediction**:
   - Predicts the trajectory of a basketball shot.
   - Uses algorithms to determine the success probability of the shot.

3. **Player Action Recognition**:
   - Detects various basketball actions (e.g., shooting, dribbling, defending).
   - Provides actionable insights for improving technique.

4. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Offers immediate suggestions based on the analysis.
   - Displays trajectory paths and movement patterns for better understanding.
